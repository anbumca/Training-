# What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for your API, providing a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST. With GraphQL, you can precisely specify the data you need, allowing clients to request only what is necessary, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

## GraphQL Schemas and Types

GraphQL schemas define the structure of your data graphically, including types for objects, scalars for data primitives, and relationships between types.

## GraphQL Queries

Queries in GraphQL define how clients retrieve data from the server. They specify the fields and arguments needed to fetch the desired data.

### Fields and Arguments

Fields are the properties of an object that can be queried, while arguments allow for filtering, sorting, and other operations on queried data.

### Aliases

Aliases in GraphQL enable clients to request multiple fields with different names from a single query.

### Fragments

Fragments provide reusable units of fields for queries, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

## GraphQL Variables

Variables in GraphQL allow clients to parameterize their queries, making them dynamic and reusable across different contexts.

### Making variables required

You can enforce the presence of variables in a query by marking them as required.

### Specifying a default value for a variable

Default values can be assigned to variables, providing fallback values if they are not explicitly provided in a query.

## GraphQL Directives

Directives in GraphQL provide a way to conditionally include or skip fields based on runtime values.

### @include(if: Boolean)

Includes a field in the response if the specified condition is true.

### @skip(if: Boolean)

Skips a field in the response if the specified condition is true.

## Resolvers

Resolvers in GraphQL are functions that resolve the value of a field in the schema. They fetch the data from the appropriate data source and format it according to the schema.

## Mutations

Mutations in GraphQL are operations used to modify data on the server. They are analogous to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in RESTful APIs.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions in GraphQL enable real-time communication between clients and servers, allowing clients to subscribe to changes in data and receive updates as they occur.

## Scalars

Scalars in GraphQL represent primitive data types like Int, String, Boolean, and Float.

## Directives

Directives provide a way to control the execution of queries and mutations in GraphQL.

## Interfaces

Interfaces in GraphQL define a contract for objects, specifying a set of fields that must be implemented by any object that implements the interface.

## Unions and Enums

Unions and Enums in GraphQL provide a way to represent a finite set of possible types or values.

## Field middleware

Field middleware in GraphQL allows for intercepting and modifying the execution of queries and mutations at the field level.

## Mapped types

Mapped types in GraphQL provide a mechanism for transforming data between the client and server, allowing for seamless integration with existing data structures.

## Plugins

Plugins in GraphQL extend its functionality by adding custom features or integrating with third-party services.

## Complexity

Complexity in GraphQL refers to the cost of executing a query or mutation, which can be managed to prevent denial-of-service attacks and optimize performance.

## Extensions

Extensions in GraphQL allow for adding custom metadata or functionality to the GraphQL server.

## CLI Plugin

CLI plugins in GraphQL provide command-line tools for tasks like schema generation, validation, and code generation.

## Generating SDL

SDL (Schema Definition Language) in GraphQL is a human-readable format for defining GraphQL schemas. Tools exist to automatically generate SDL from existing GraphQL schemas.

## Sharing models

GraphQL schemas can be shared between client and server, enabling seamless communication and ensuring consistency across applications.

## Other features

GraphQL also supports advanced features like federation, which allows for composing multiple GraphQL schemas into a single, federated schema.

## Federation

GraphQL Federation enables the composition of multiple GraphQL services into a single, cohesive API, facilitating scalability and modular development.
